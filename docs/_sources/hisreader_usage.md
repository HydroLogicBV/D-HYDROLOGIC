# Usage
D-Hydro results stored in history files (_his.nc) can be extracted and processed using the provided his(tory file)reader.
By default *hisreader<span>.py</span>* extracts timeseries for all observation points and structures for which output is provided and stores them as individual pandas-compatible csv files.
Advanced usage allows the direct processing of the results, e.g. to combine simulated results with measurements and to generate plots for quick inspection of the results.
